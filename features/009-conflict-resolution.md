# Conflict Resolution

## Description

### Problem
When multiple memories apply to the same situation, they might conflict with each other. Without proper conflict resolution, users would receive inconsistent or contradictory guidance.

### Solution Proposal
Create a conflict resolution system that:
- Detects conflicting rules
- Applies precedence rules
- Resolves conflicts consistently
- Explains resolution decisions

## User Stories

### 1. Resolving Rule Conflicts
**As a** developer  
**I want to** know which rule to follow when rules conflict  
**So that** I make the right choice

**Workflow:**
1. System detects conflicting rules
2. System applies precedence rules
3. System determines winner
4. Developer sees clear guidance

**Expected Result:**  
Conflicts are resolved consistently and clearly.

### 2. Understanding Resolutions
**As a** team member  
**I want to** understand why one rule won over another  
**So that** I can explain decisions to others

**Workflow:**
1. System shows conflicting rules
2. System explains precedence
3. System shows resolution logic
4. Team member understands decision

**Expected Result:**  
Resolution decisions are clear and explainable.

### 3. Handling Exceptions
**As a** project lead  
**I want to** handle special case conflicts  
**So that** unusual situations are handled properly

**Workflow:**
1. System detects special case
2. System applies exception rules
3. System explains special handling
4. Lead verifies correct resolution

**Expected Result:**  
Special cases are handled appropriately.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Conflict Detection**
- [ ] Conflicts identified correctly
- [ ] All conflict types handled
- [ ] Special cases recognized
- [ ] Clear conflict reporting

2. **Resolution Process**
- [ ] Consistent resolution rules
- [ ] Clear precedence order
- [ ] Exception handling works
- [ ] Decisions explained clearly

3. **User Experience**
- [ ] Clear resolution display
- [ ] Explanation is understandable
- [ ] Override option available
- [ ] History is maintained

## Technical Notes
```typescript
// Conflict resolution
interface ConflictResolver {
  detectConflicts(matches: Match[]): Conflict[]
  applyPrecedenceRules(conflict: Conflict): Resolution
  explainResolution(resolution: Resolution): Explanation
  handleException(conflict: Conflict): Resolution
}

// Resolution tracking
interface ResolutionTracker {
  recordResolution(resolution: Resolution): void
  getResolutionHistory(conflict: Conflict): Resolution[]
  validateConsistency(resolutions: Resolution[]): boolean
}
```
