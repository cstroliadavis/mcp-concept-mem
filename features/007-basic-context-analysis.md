# Basic Context Analysis

## Description

### Problem
The system needs to understand what the user is currently doing to provide relevant guidance. Without context awareness, the system can't determine which memories apply to the current situation.

### Solution Proposal
Create a context analysis system that:
- Identifies current work context
- Recognizes basic patterns
- Determines relevant scope
- Extracts key information

## User Stories

### 1. Project Context Detection
**As a** developer  
**I want to** automatically detect my current project context  
**So that** relevant project rules are applied

**Workflow:**
1. Developer opens a project file
2. System analyzes file location and type
3. System identifies project context
4. Relevant project settings are available

**Expected Result:**  
System correctly identifies the current project context.

### 2. Technology Recognition
**As a** developer  
**I want to** have the system recognize what technology I'm using  
**So that** appropriate standards are applied

**Workflow:**
1. Developer works with specific files
2. System recognizes file types
3. System identifies technologies
4. Technology-specific rules are available

**Expected Result:**  
System correctly identifies technologies in use.

### 3. Activity Detection
**As a** developer  
**I want to** have my current activity recognized  
**So that** relevant guidance is provided

**Workflow:**
1. Developer performs specific tasks
2. System analyzes work patterns
3. System identifies activity type
4. Activity-specific memories are available

**Expected Result:**  
System correctly identifies current activities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Context Detection**
- [ ] Project context identified
- [ ] Technology stack recognized
- [ ] Activity type determined
- [ ] Scope properly set

2. **Pattern Recognition**
- [ ] File types recognized
- [ ] Basic work patterns identified
- [ ] Common activities detected
- [ ] Context changes tracked

3. **Performance**
- [ ] Quick context analysis
- [ ] Minimal resource usage
- [ ] Real-time updates
- [ ] Smooth transitions

## Technical Notes
```typescript
// Context analysis
interface ContextAnalyzer {
  analyzeFile(path: string): FileContext
  analyzeProject(root: string): ProjectContext
  analyzeActivity(events: ActivityEvent[]): ActivityContext
  detectContextChange(previous: Context, current: Context): ContextChange
}

// Pattern detection
interface PatternDetector {
  detectTechnology(files: string[]): Technology[]
  detectActivity(events: ActivityEvent[]): Activity
  detectScope(context: Context): Scope
}
```
