# Basic Memory Operations

## Description

### Problem
Users need a reliable way to save and retrieve their preferences and rules. Without basic storage capabilities, the system can't maintain any information between sessions.

### Solution Proposal
Create fundamental storage operations that:
- Save new preferences and rules
- Retrieve stored information
- Update existing entries
- Remove outdated items

## User Stories

### 1. Saving New Preferences
**As a** developer  
**I want to** save my code formatting preferences  
**So that** they can be applied consistently

**Workflow:**
1. Developer specifies a formatting preference
2. System validates the basic information
3. System saves the preference
4. System confirms successful storage

**Expected Result:**  
Preference is stored and can be retrieved later.

### 2. Retrieving Preferences
**As a** developer  
**I want to** look up my saved preferences  
**So that** I can review or share them

**Workflow:**
1. Developer requests to see preferences
2. System retrieves stored preferences
3. System displays preferences clearly
4. Developer can verify preferences

**Expected Result:**  
Stored preferences are accurately retrieved and displayed.

### 3. Updating Preferences
**As a** developer  
**I want to** modify my existing preferences  
**So that** they reflect my current needs

**Workflow:**
1. Developer requests to change a preference
2. System shows current preference
3. Developer provides new value
4. System updates the preference

**Expected Result:**  
Preference is updated while maintaining other information.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Basic Operations**
- [ ] Can create new entries
- [ ] Can retrieve entries by ID
- [ ] Can update existing entries
- [ ] Can remove entries

2. **Data Validation**
- [ ] Required fields are checked
- [ ] Invalid data is rejected
- [ ] Success/failure is clearly indicated
- [ ] Errors provide clear messages

3. **Performance**
- [ ] Operations complete quickly
- [ ] System handles multiple requests
- [ ] Storage space is managed
- [ ] Basic error recovery works

## Technical Notes
```typescript
// Core operations interface
interface BasicOperations {
  create(data: NewMemory): Promise<string>
  retrieve(id: string): Promise<Memory>
  update(id: string, data: PartialMemory): Promise<void>
  remove(id: string): Promise<void>
}

// Basic validation
interface Validator {
  validateNew(data: NewMemory): ValidationResult
  validateUpdate(data: PartialMemory): ValidationResult
}
```
