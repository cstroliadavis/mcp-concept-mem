# Recovery Management

## Description

### Problem
Sometimes memories need to be restored from archives or repaired after issues. Without proper recovery management, we risk losing access to important historical information or leaving corrupted data in the system.

### Solution Proposal
Create a recovery system that:
- Restores archived memories
- Repairs corrupted data
- Validates recovered information
- Maintains data integrity

## User Stories

### 1. Archive Recovery
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** restore archived memories  
**So that** old information can be accessed when needed

**Workflow:**
1. Admin requests restoration
2. System locates archive
3. System validates data
4. System restores memories

**Expected Result:**  
Archived memories are successfully restored.

### 2. Data Repair
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** fix corrupted memories  
**So that** data integrity is maintained

**Workflow:**
1. System detects corruption
2. Admin initiates repair
3. System fixes issues
4. System verifies repair

**Expected Result:**  
Corrupted data is properly repaired.

### 3. Selective Recovery
**As a** team lead  
**I want to** restore specific memories  
**So that** I can access needed historical data

**Workflow:**
1. Lead identifies needed memories
2. System finds archives
3. System restores selected items
4. Lead verifies restoration

**Expected Result:**  
Specific memories are accurately restored.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Restoration Process**
- [ ] Archive location works
- [ ] Data validation
- [ ] Relationship recovery
- [ ] Integrity checks

2. **Repair Operations**
- [ ] Corruption detection
- [ ] Repair procedures
- [ ] Validation steps

- [ ] Progress tracking
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Success verification

## Technical Notes
```typescript
// Recovery management
interface RecoveryManager {
  restoreFromArchive(archiveId: string): Promise<RecoveryResult>
  repairMemory(memoryId: string): Promise<RepairResult>
  validateRecovery(recoveryId: string): ValidationResult
  trackProgress(operationId: string): Progress
}

// Repair operations
interface RepairOperations {
  detectCorruption(memory: Memory): CorruptionReport
  attemptRepair(memory: Memory): RepairAttempt
  verifyRepair(memory: Memory): VerificationResult
}
```
