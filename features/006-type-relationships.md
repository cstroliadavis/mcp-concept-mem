# Type Relationships

## Description

### Problem
Memory types often need to build on or relate to other types. Without a way to manage these relationships, we can't create specialized types or ensure proper inheritance of rules and behaviors.

### Solution Proposal
Create a type relationship system that:
- Manages type inheritance
- Tracks type dependencies
- Handles type extensions
- Maintains type hierarchy

## User Stories

### 1. Creating Specialized Types
**As a** team lead  
**I want to** create project-specific versions of standard types  
**So that** we can customize while maintaining core rules

**Workflow:**
1. Lead identifies base type
2. Lead specifies extensions
3. System creates new type
4. Team uses specialized type

**Expected Result:**  
New type inherits and extends base type properly.

### 2. Managing Dependencies
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** track type dependencies  
**So that** changes don't break related types

**Workflow:**
1. Admin reviews type changes
2. System shows dependencies
3. Admin assesses impact
4. Changes preserve relationships

**Expected Result:**  
Type changes maintain system consistency.

### 3. Understanding Hierarchy
**As a** developer  
**I want to** understand type relationships  
**So that** I use the right type for my needs

**Workflow:**
1. Developer explores types
2. System shows relationships
3. System explains inheritance
4. Developer chooses correctly

**Expected Result:**  
Type relationships are clear and useful.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Type Inheritance**
- [ ] Base type rules inherited
- [ ] Extensions work properly
- [ ] Overrides handled correctly
- [ ] Inheritance chain clear

2. **Dependency Management**
- [ ] Dependencies tracked
- [ ] Changes validated
- [ ] Conflicts prevented
- [ ] Updates propagated

3. **Hierarchy Navigation**
- [ ] Clear type tree
- [ ] Easy relationship viewing
- [ ] Impact analysis
- [ ] History maintained

## Technical Notes
```typescript
// Type relationships
interface TypeRelationship {
  parent: TypeDefinition
  child: TypeDefinition
  relationship: RelationType
  overrides: Override[]
}

// Hierarchy management
interface TypeHierarchy {
  addRelationship(parent: string, child: string): void
  validateChange(type: string, change: Change): ValidationResult
  getDescendants(type: string): TypeDefinition[]
  getAncestors(type: string): TypeDefinition[]
}
```
