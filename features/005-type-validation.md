# Type Validation

## Description

### Problem
When memories are created or updated, they must conform to their type definitions. Without proper validation, invalid or incomplete memories could be stored, leading to system inconsistency and errors.

### Solution Proposal
Create a validation system that:
- Checks memories against type rules
- Provides clear error messages
- Suggests fixes for issues
- Maintains data quality

## User Stories

### 1. Validating New Memories
**As a** developer  
**I want to** know if my memory is properly formatted  
**So that** I can fix any issues before saving

**Workflow:**
1. Developer creates new memory
2. System checks against type rules
3. System reports any issues
4. Developer can fix problems

**Expected Result:**  
Invalid memories are caught before being saved.

### 2. Understanding Errors
**As a** team member  
**I want to** get clear error messages  
**So that** I know exactly what to fix

**Workflow:**
1. System finds validation error
2. System explains the problem
3. System suggests fixes
4. Team member can correct issues

**Expected Result:**  
Validation errors are clear and actionable.

### 3. Fixing Issues
**As a** user  
**I want to** get help fixing invalid memories  
**So that** I can correct problems quickly

**Workflow:**
1. System detects problems
2. System suggests corrections
3. User reviews suggestions
4. User applies fixes

**Expected Result:**  
Problems can be fixed efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Validation Rules**
- [ ] Required fields checked
- [ ] Field types verified
- [ ] Constraints enforced
- [ ] Format rules applied

2. **Error Reporting**
- [ ] Clear error messages
- [ ] Problem location shown
- [ ] Fix suggestions provided
- [ ] Multiple errors handled

3. **User Experience**
- [ ] Quick validation
- [ ] Helpful messages
- [ ] Easy corrections
- [ ] Batch validation

## Technical Notes
```typescript
// Validation system
interface TypeValidator {
  validate(memory: Memory): ValidationResult
  checkField(field: Field, value: unknown): FieldResult
  suggestFix(error: ValidationError): FixSuggestion
  batchValidate(memories: Memory[]): ValidationResult[]
}

// Error reporting
interface ValidationReporter {
  formatError(error: ValidationError): string
  getFixSuggestions(error: ValidationError): string[]
  generateReport(results: ValidationResult[]): Report
}
```
