# Health Monitoring

## Description

### Problem
The system needs to track the health and usage of memories over time. Without monitoring, we can't identify stale, unused, or problematic memories that need attention.

### Solution Proposal
Create a health monitoring system that:
- Tracks memory usage
- Monitors memory health
- Identifies issues
- Reports status

## User Stories

### 1. Usage Tracking
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** know how memories are being used  
**So that** I can identify important patterns

**Workflow:**
1. System tracks memory access
2. System records usage patterns
3. System analyzes trends
4. Admin reviews statistics

**Expected Result:**  
Clear understanding of memory usage patterns.

### 2. Health Assessment
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** know the health of memories  
**So that** I can address problems early

**Workflow:**
1. System checks memory health
2. System identifies issues
3. System rates severity
4. Admin gets health report

**Expected Result:**  
Memory health issues are identified early.

### 3. Status Reporting
**As a** team lead  
**I want to** get regular health reports  
**So that** I can maintain system quality

**Workflow:**
1. System generates reports
2. System highlights issues
3. System suggests actions
4. Lead reviews findings

**Expected Result:**  
Regular, actionable health insights.

## Technical Notes
```typescript
// Health monitoring
interface HealthMonitor {
  trackUsage(memory: Memory): void
  assessHealth(memory: Memory): HealthStatus
  generateReport(criteria: ReportCriteria): HealthReport
  detectIssues(): Issue[]
}

// Usage tracking
interface UsageTracker {
  recordAccess(memory: Memory): void
  analyzePatterns(): UsagePattern[]
  calculateMetrics(): UsageMetrics
}
```
