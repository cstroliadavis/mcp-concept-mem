# Integration Layer

## Description

### Problem
The core memory system needs to work with MCP while remaining independent. Without a proper integration layer, we risk tight coupling and make it harder to use the system outside of MCP.

### Solution Proposal
Create an integration layer that:
- Adapts core functionality to MCP
- Maintains system independence
- Handles protocol translation
- Manages communication

## User Stories

### 1. Protocol Translation
**As a** system integrator  
**I want to** connect core functions to MCP  
**So that** AI assistants can use them

**Workflow:**
1. MCP request arrives
2. Layer translates request
3. Core system processes
4. Layer formats response

**Expected Result:**  
Seamless communication between MCP and core system.

### 2. Independent Operation
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** use the system without MCP  
**So that** it works in different contexts

**Workflow:**
1. Admin uses direct interface
2. System works independently
3. MCP remains optional
4. Functionality preserved

**Expected Result:**  
System works with or without MCP.

### 3. Error Handling
**As a** developer  
**I want to** properly handle integration issues  
**So that** problems are clearly reported

**Workflow:**
1. Error occurs in core system
2. Layer catches error
3. Layer translates error
4. MCP receives proper response

**Expected Result:**  
Errors are handled appropriately across layers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Adaptation**
- [ ] Clean interface mapping
- [ ] Protocol compliance
- [ ] Data transformation
- [ ] State management

2. **Independence**
- [ ] No core MCP dependencies
- [ ] Clean separation
- [ ] Direct usage works
- [ ] Easy switching

3. **Error Management**
- [ ] Error translation
- [ ] Clear reporting
- [ ] Recovery options
- [ ] Logging support

## Technical Notes
```typescript
// Integration layer
interface IntegrationLayer {
  translateRequest(mcpRequest: McpRequest): CoreRequest
  translateResponse(coreResponse: CoreResponse): McpResponse
  translateError(error: CoreError): McpError
  validateIntegration(): IntegrationStatus
}

// Communication management
interface CommunicationManager {
  handleRequest(request: McpRequest): Promise<McpResponse>
  maintainConnection(): void
  monitorHealth(): HealthStatus
}
```
