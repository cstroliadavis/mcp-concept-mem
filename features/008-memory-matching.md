# Memory Matching

## Description

### Problem
Once we understand the current context, we need to find memories that are relevant to that context. Without effective matching, we can't connect the right preferences and rules to the current situation.

### Solution Proposal
Create a matching system that:
- Finds relevant memories
- Ranks them by importance
- Handles partial matches
- Considers multiple factors

## User Stories

### 1. Finding Relevant Rules
**As a** developer  
**I want to** see rules that apply to my current work  
**So that** I follow the right standards

**Workflow:**
1. System has current context
2. System searches for matching rules
3. System ranks matches by relevance
4. Developer sees applicable rules

**Expected Result:**  
Most relevant rules are identified and presented.

### 2. Partial Matching
**As a** developer  
**I want to** find rules that might partially apply  
**So that** I don't miss useful guidance

**Workflow:**
1. System looks for exact matches
2. System considers partial matches
3. System ranks all matches
4. Developer sees both direct and related rules

**Expected Result:**  
Both exact and relevant partial matches are found.

### 3. Priority Ranking
**As a** team member  
**I want to** see the most important rules first  
**So that** I focus on critical standards

**Workflow:**
1. System finds matching rules
2. System considers rule priorities
3. System ranks results
4. Team member sees prioritized list

**Expected Result:**  
Rules are presented in order of importance.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Match Finding**
- [ ] Exact matches identified
- [ ] Partial matches found
- [ ] Search is comprehensive
- [ ] No relevant rules missed

2. **Ranking**
- [ ] Clear relevance scoring
- [ ] Priority consideration
- [ ] Context weight applied
- [ ] Consistent ordering

3. **Performance**
- [ ] Quick match finding
- [ ] Efficient ranking
- [ ] Handles large sets
- [ ] Results cached appropriately

## Technical Notes
```typescript
// Match finding
interface MemoryMatcher {
  findExactMatches(context: Context): Promise<Match[]>
  findPartialMatches(context: Context): Promise<Match[]>
  rankMatches(matches: Match[]): RankedMatch[]
  scoreRelevance(match: Match, context: Context): number
}

// Ranking system
interface RankingSystem {
  calculateScore(match: Match): number
  applyWeights(score: number, factors: Factor[]): number
  sortResults(matches: RankedMatch[]): RankedMatch[]
}
```
