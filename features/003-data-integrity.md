# Data Integrity

## Description

### Problem
Memory data must remain consistent and valid, even during updates or system issues. Without proper data integrity, memories could become corrupted or inconsistent, leading to unreliable behavior and potential data loss.

### Solution Proposal
Create a data integrity system that:
- Validates all data changes
- Maintains consistency during updates
- Prevents data corruption
- Recovers from errors
- Tracks data history

## User Stories

### 1. Safe Updates
**As a** system user  
**I want to** safely update multiple related preferences  
**So that** all changes succeed or none do

**Workflow:**
1. User initiates multiple changes
2. System checks all changes for validity
3. System applies changes atomically
4. System confirms success or rolls back

**Expected Result:**  
All changes succeed together or system remains unchanged.

### 2. Data Recovery
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** recover from unexpected issues  
**So that** no data is lost or corrupted

**Workflow:**
1. System detects an issue
2. System preserves current state
3. System attempts recovery
4. System reports outcome

**Expected Result:**  
Data remains consistent even after system issues.

### 3. Change Validation
**As a** developer  
**I want to** ensure my changes are valid  
**So that** I don't introduce bad data

**Workflow:**
1. Developer submits changes
2. System validates all aspects
3. System shows any issues
4. Developer can fix problems

**Expected Result:**  
Only valid changes are accepted into the system.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Data Validation**
- [ ] All changes are validated
- [ ] Invalid changes are rejected
- [ ] Validation rules are consistent
- [ ] Clear error messages provided

2. **Transaction Management**
- [ ] Multiple changes are atomic
- [ ] Failed operations roll back
- [ ] System state remains consistent
- [ ] Operations can be retried

3. **Error Recovery**
- [ ] System detects issues
- [ ] Recovery procedures work
- [ ] Data remains consistent
- [ ] History is maintained

## Technical Notes
```typescript
// Integrity management
interface IntegrityManager {
  validateChange(change: Change): ValidationResult
  beginTransaction(): Transaction
  rollback(transaction: Transaction): Promise<void>
  commit(transaction: Transaction): Promise<void>
  verifyConsistency(): Promise<ConsistencyReport>
}

// History tracking
interface HistoryManager {
  recordChange(change: Change): Promise<void>
  getHistory(id: string): Promise<ChangeHistory>
  restoreVersion(id: string, version: number): Promise<void>
}
```
