# Memory Relationships

## Description

### Problem
Preferences and rules often relate to or affect each other. Without a way to track these relationships, the system can't understand how changes to one rule might impact others, leading to inconsistencies and conflicts.

### Solution Proposal
Create a relationship management system that:
- Tracks connections between memories
- Maintains relationship integrity
- Shows how memories influence each other
- Helps prevent conflicts

## User Stories

### 1. Connecting Related Rules
**As a** team lead  
**I want to** link related coding standards  
**So that** changes to one standard update related ones

**Workflow:**
1. Lead identifies related standards
2. System shows potential connections
3. Lead confirms relationships
4. System records connections

**Expected Result:**  
Related standards are properly linked and maintained together.

### 2. Understanding Dependencies
**As a** developer  
**I want to** see what other rules might be affected by a change  
**So that** I don't accidentally break existing standards

**Workflow:**
1. Developer selects a rule to change
2. System shows connected rules
3. Developer reviews impacts
4. System helps prevent conflicts

**Expected Result:**  
Developer understands the impact of changes before making them.

### 3. Managing Rule Precedence
**As a** project manager  
**I want to** establish which rules take priority  
**So that** conflicts are resolved consistently

**Workflow:**
1. Manager reviews related rules
2. System shows current priorities
3. Manager adjusts precedence
4. System updates relationships

**Expected Result:**  
Clear rule precedence is established and maintained.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Relationship Management**
- [ ] Can create relationships
- [ ] Can update relationships
- [ ] Can remove relationships
- [ ] Relationships are bi-directional

2. **Integrity**
- [ ] Related items stay in sync
- [ ] Broken links are detected
- [ ] Circular references prevented
- [ ] Updates maintain consistency

3. **Usability**
- [ ] Relationships are easy to understand
- [ ] Impact of changes is clear
- [ ] Precedence is obvious
- [ ] Conflicts are highlighted

## Technical Notes
```typescript
// Relationship types
type RelationType = 'requires' | 'suggests' | 'conflicts' | 'supersedes'

// Relationship management
interface RelationshipManager {
  connect(from: string, to: string, type: RelationType): Promise<void>
  disconnect(from: string, to: string): Promise<void>
  getRelated(id: string): Promise<Relationship[]>
  validateRelationships(id: string): Promise<ValidationResult>
}
```
