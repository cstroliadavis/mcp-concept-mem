# Cleanup Operations

## Description

### Problem
Over time, memories can become outdated or irrelevant. Without proper cleanup procedures, the system accumulates stale data that impacts performance and clarity.

### Solution Proposal
Create a cleanup system that:
- Archives old memories
- Removes unused data
- Preserves important information
- Maintains system efficiency

## User Stories

### 1. Memory Archival
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** archive old memories safely  
**So that** they don't clutter the active system

**Workflow:**
1. System identifies archive candidates
2. Admin reviews suggestions
3. System performs archival
4. Archives remain accessible

**Expected Result:**  
Old memories are safely archived and retrievable.

### 2. Data Cleanup
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** remove unnecessary data  
**So that** system performance stays optimal

**Workflow:**
1. System finds unused data
2. Admin reviews cleanup plan
3. System removes data
4. Performance improves

**Expected Result:**  
Unnecessary data is safely removed.

### 3. Preservation Rules
**As a** team lead  
**I want to** protect important memories  
**So that** valuable information isn't lost

**Workflow:**
1. Lead marks critical memories
2. System respects protection
3. System skips protected items
4. Important data remains safe

**Expected Result:**  
Important memories are preserved during cleanup.

## Technical Notes
```typescript
// Cleanup management
interface CleanupManager {
  identifyCandidates(): CleanupCandidate[]
  performArchival(candidates: string[]): ArchiveResult
  removeData(criteria: CleanupCriteria): CleanupResult
  validateProtection(item: Memory): boolean
}

// Archive handling
interface ArchiveManager {
  createArchive(memories: Memory[]): Archive
  storeArchive(archive: Archive): void
  retrieveArchive(id: string): Archive
  listArchives(): ArchiveInfo[]
}
```
