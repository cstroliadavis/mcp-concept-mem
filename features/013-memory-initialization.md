# Memory Initialization

## Description

### Problem
Setting up development preferences and standards from scratch is time-consuming and error-prone. Users need a way to start with sensible defaults while still being able to customize rules according to their needs.

### Solution Proposal
Create a setup system that:
- Provides industry-standard defaults
- Guides users through customization
- Allows selective adoption of standards
- Makes it easy to adjust settings later
- Preserves user customizations

## User Stories

### 1. Initial System Setup
**As a** new user  
**I want to** quickly set up my development preferences  
**So that** I can start working with good practices immediately

**Workflow:**
1. User starts system for the first time
2. System presents common development standards
3. User reviews and customizes standards
4. System applies selected preferences

**Expected Result:**  
System is ready to use with personalized settings based on best practices.

### 2. Preset Management
**As a** team lead  
**I want to** establish team-wide development standards  
**So that** all team members follow consistent practices

**Workflow:**
1. Lead selects relevant default standards
2. System shows how standards work together
3. Lead customizes standards for team needs
4. System validates changes for consistency

**Expected Result:**  
Team has consistent, customized standards based on best practices.

### 3. Preference Updates
**As a** developer  
**I want to** modify default settings as I learn better practices  
**So that** my preferences evolve with my experience

**Workflow:**
1. Developer identifies preference to change
2. System shows current setting and alternatives
3. Developer adjusts the setting
4. System updates while preserving other preferences

**Expected Result:**  
Preferences can be easily updated while maintaining overall consistency.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Technical Notes
```typescript
// Initialization system
interface InitializationSystem {
  loadDefaults(): DefaultSettings
  customizeSettings(changes: CustomSettings): ValidationResult
  applySettings(settings: Settings): Promise<void>
  validateConfiguration(): ConfigurationStatus
}

// Preset management
interface PresetManager {
  listPresets(): Preset[]
  customizePreset(preset: Preset, changes: Changes): Preset
  validatePreset(preset: Preset): ValidationResult
}
```
